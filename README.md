You'll need compass to play with this.

You can install Compass from http://compass-style.org/ or by typing:

    $ gem update --system
    $ gem install compass

and then:

    $ compass watch

at the command line.

`index.html` contains all the javascript and HTML used, `sass/` contains the
Compass source files, and `stylesheets/` contains the compiled styles.
